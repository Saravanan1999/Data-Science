The cow jumped over the moon.
The little dog laughed to see such sport,
And the dish ran away with the spoon.

Hear me shout
“Tip me over

With vinegar and brown paper.

And said “Miss Polly put her straight to bed.”

How I wonder what you are!
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.

When he nothing shines upon,
When you shower your little light,
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.

Clap your hands together, 1, 2, 3,
Put your hands down on your knees
